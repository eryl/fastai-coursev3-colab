# Fast.AI notebooks from course.fast.ai version 3

These notebooks have been modified to make working in colab easier, including installing the prerequisite libraries and mounting your google drive as persistant storage.
This is based on original work by Jeremy Howard et. al, see https://github.com/fastai/course-v3.
